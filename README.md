## What is Cook&Save

Cook&Save is a school project which in the form of a mobile application to help people throw less food away, we were concerned about how much food is being thrown away because it was in the fridge for too long. We had an idea, create an application to help people get ideas about how to use the remaining food in their fridges, here's Cook&Save;
